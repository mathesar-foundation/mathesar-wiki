# Project Title

## Synopsis
***In your own words**, provide a one paragraph synopsis of the project and outcomes you are proposing in this section.*

## Implementation
*Describe how your solution will be implemented in Mathesar. Provide as many technical details as possible with references to how your solution will fit into the current code, APIs, and UI.*

### API spec
*If your project involves APIs, please propose an API spec here. API specs should include URLs and exanple JSON requests and responses.*

### UX design
*If your project involves UI changes, describe the UI changes that will be needed. Be specific about which screens need to change. Also include wireframes / mockups.*

### Architectural / UX problems
*Describe the architectural and/or UX problems in this project and explain how you plan to solve them.*

### External Dependencies
*If your solution involves adding external libraries to use, provide details about your choices and the reasons behind those choices.*

### Research & References
*Include any research you've done or references that you've found related to your solution here.*

## Timeline & Deliverables
*Include a timeline of the deliverables you aim to accomplish each week. Add one row per 1-2 weeks. We use this section to determine whether you can plan your project out properly, so please choose your deliverables well.*

*Deliverables should be **measurable** and as specific as possible.*
- :white_check_mark: *“Complete API for cancelling orders” is a good deliverable. It's easy to tell whether it's been completed.*
- :x: *“Work on APIs” is a bad deliverable. It's not measurable.*

*[The GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) should be helpful in determining dates.*
