## Classification
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Skills needed**: Python, SQL, JavaScript, Svelte

## The Problem
* Mathesar currently does not persist certain user-defined configurations, such as:
  - Column widths in tables and explorations
  - Open/closed state of the Table Inspector and Exploration Inspector
  - Sidebar widths
* The objectives of this project are to:
  - Identify any other non-persisted user configurations
  - Store the aforementioned information in the backend

## Tasks
* Come up with a specification document containing the database schema, backend work, and API request/response structure necessary to persist the data mentioned in "The Problem" section.
* Work with the Mathesar backend and frontend teams to finalize the specifications.
* Implement the necessary backend work.
* Implement the frontend work to send API requests when user modifies any of these configurations.

## Expected Outcome
* Users' changes to the UI should be persisted as described in "The Problem" section.

## Application Tips
* Show proficiency in the required skills.
* Provide a preliminary approach to solving the challenge, including the database schema and API specifications.
* Demonstrate a good understanding of the Mathesar codebase.
