We welcome contributions of all kinds to Mathesar!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. See the [Community](/community) page for how to find us.

# Code
Mathesar's development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar). If you are not familiar with GitHub or pull requests, please follow [GitHub's "Hello World" guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) first.

You may also want to visit our [Engineering](/engineering) page to learn more about our development process.

## Finding an Issue

If you'd like an issue to work on, we can help you find one! Please join the "General" channel on our [Matrix server](/community) and introduce yourself. Information about your skillset and how much time you have available to work on an issue is helpful for us to figure out what task to assign you to.

You can also find an issue to work on from our [issues page](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues).
  - Unassigned issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` are especially tagged for contributors.

    - [Issues tagged `help wanted`](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
  - Unassigned issues tagged `status: ready` are also fair game.

If you want to work on something for which there is no GitHub issue open yet, create an issue and propose your change there. A Mathesar [team member](/team) will evaluate your issue and decide whether we'll accept a pull request for the issue. If we indicate that we will accept a PR, then go ahead and start work on it.

## Contributing
Once you've found an issue to work on, 

- Comment on it and say you'd like to work on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.
- A Mathesar [team member](/team) will assign you to that issue.
- Write your code and submit your pull request. Be sure to read and follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
- Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.

## Code Review
We encourage and appreciate code review by contributors. Feel free to review any open pull requests. Follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
