Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably – **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**. You host your own Mathesar installation, which gives you ownership, privacy, and control of your data.

## Current status
Mathesar's is in public alpha as of March 2023. We are actively looking for users to test and help improve our product.

Please see https://docs.mathesar.org/ for information on how to install Mathesar. Please open an issue on [our GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar) for any issues you encounter.

## About the wiki
The Mathesar wiki is aimed at **people who are helping build Mathesar**. Please see our [main website](https://mathesar.org) for information about Mathesar aimed at general audiences.
