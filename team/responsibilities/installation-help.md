## Tasks

- Help find notable use cases for Mathesar, and drive whatever needs to be built to make those use cases work.
    
    e.g. we talked about using Mathesar in the Chelsea Project to share wastewater data. someone needs to look at the data, get it into Mathesar, talk to Sam to get her requirements for what she wants sharing to look like, break it down into features for Mathesar, etc.
