## Cycle 5 progress check-in

**Participants:** Core team, Kriti out

- Brent:
  - worried about live demo
  - worried about bugs

- Mukesh:
  - worried about not much (except bugs)
  - moving into Users and Permissions

- Rajat:
  - Constraints modal (styling)
      - not likely done by Dday, need to prioritize
  - Navigation (styling)
      - not likely done by DDay, need to prioritize

- Pavish:
  - Pretty terrified
      - DE increasing scope, but confident we'll be able to make it before 22nd
  - May not have time to put into data import page
      - depends on the design
  - Not going to be able to help with column types or table page

- Sean:
  - Hard to tell;
  - Design implementations remaining
  - Would help for prioritization to have more designs ready


- General discussion
  - Deprioritizing table linking modal UX
  - Moved constraints modal down

# UX & Implementation details for auto-aggregation

**Participants:** Pavish, Dominykas, Brent, Ghislaine, Mukesh

- We realized summarization suggestions are a prerequisite
- Finalized some expectations around the summarization suggestions
  - backend will always assume "partial" (and any non-specified columns will be automatically assigned to either "group_by" or "aggregation" sets)
  - new required field: 'base_grouping_column' that the suggestion algo needs to make above assignments
  - This allows adding more initial columns after the fact, and assigning them appropriately.
- For now, no multiple summarization (we realized that even including auto-agg, multiple summarizations would be rarely needed (2A above)
- Still working through some implementation details of auto-aggregation setup.
