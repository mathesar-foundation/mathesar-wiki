## About

**What are projects for?**
- The Mathesar team's work is chunked into fixed-length projects to keep it organized.
- The core team works in 4-week "cycles", and each project is designed to fit into that timeline. The community team's project lengths vary.
  - Projects always have an end date. Work without an end date is tracked under [ongoing responsibilities](/team/responsibilities.md),
- Each project has one and only owner, and various helpers. Helpers are assigned specific responsibilities.

**How do we decide what projects work on?**
- Anyone willing to do the work can propose a project. Please use the [project template](/en/projects/template).
- Projects are discussed and approved by the core team (either in meetings or via email).
  - The project manager facilitates these discussions.
- Project prioritization will be based on our product strategy (currently in development).
