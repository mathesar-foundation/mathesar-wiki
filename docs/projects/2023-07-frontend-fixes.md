## Problem

Time for some fixes.

## Solution

This project focuses on the cell selection functionality. It starts by addressing some long-due refactoring of the cell selection code. The front end team recently discussed the need for this refactor because it has been a particularly buggy area of the front end codebase. Improving it will lay groundwork for fixing other bugs related to the cell selection logic and implementing new features.

- [Change the data structure to store selections in the selection store](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/1732)
- [Cell selection partially broken after selecting columns when table is filtered to be empty](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2845)
- [Do not select columns when hovering column headers in a table with no rows](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2130)
- [Weird cell selection behavior when dragging from cell to header](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2122)
- [Cell Context menu event should maintain the cell selection when triggered within the selection](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/1771)
