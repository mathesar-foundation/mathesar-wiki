## Problem

- Develop UX design for the quick save functionality.

- Assessing the feasibility of the quick save feature might require extensive discussions and evaluations with both the frontend and backend teams, which could be time-consuming.
- Balancing the desired user experience with implementation constraints might prove challenging, potentially necessitating compromises in the final product.
