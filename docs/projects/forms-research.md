## Problem
We want to know if there's a form-like feature-set we could implement without too much effort that would actually be useful to our probable userbase.

## Solution

It is not obvious that copying competing solutions would be a useful strategy, so we're largely looking at survey/interview research as the source of insight. Intersects with the ["Gathering User Feedback" project](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/projects/gather-user-feedback).
 
- Build the qualifying survey
- Perform the qualifying survey
- Analyze the qualifying survey
- Perform qualitative interviews with those that qualified in the survey
	- Use the jobs-to-be-done framework
- Analyze the qualitative interviews
	- Doesn't involve writing a product spec
  
## Risks
- Project might take too long
	- Reasons why this might happen
  		- This kind of research is new to me, learning is involved
      - It is easy to get carried away with research
  - Setting deadlines might help

## Resources
> This section collects project related resources. It's expected that there might not be anything here until the project plan is approved, and this section will grow over the project's timeframe.
