**Name**: Raise additional funding for Mathesar
**Status**: Moved to [ongoing responsibilities](/en/team/responsibilities) in July 2023.

## Team

*This project doesn't have an Approver because Kriti approves most projects.*

## Problem
Mathesar is currently grant funded. Our plan is to be financially self-sustainable through sponsorships and offering Mathesar-related services, but we need additional grant funding to sustain us until that point.

## Solution
- Determine budget and financial needs for Mathesar from 2023-2025.
- Investigate and apply to potential grants.
- Get advice from relevant people to help with strategy, pitch, and grant applications.
- Follow ups and additional tasks as needed.

This is pretty high-level, since tasks will vary depending on the grant.

## Risks
- We have a limited runway, so timing is critical.

## Timeline
This project started in **mid-March 2023**. Since completion depends on third-parties, we don't have a fixed timeline. This project will be updated when it's completed.
