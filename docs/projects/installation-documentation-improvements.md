## Problem
* Users are trying to use Mathesar with various setups and our installation documentation is lacking information to help them with it
  1. Users want to use Mathesar with Kubernetes, Nomad etc. Our docker-compose script won't be helpful in such cases
	2. The installation script asks for `sudo` access, [so some users are not comfortable with it](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2761)
  3. The installation script is tightly coupled, [preventing them from using it with their own setup](https://hackmd.io/wUpuiOwLRhGDy2y7H-ccHw). The user cannot use the script to do only certain tasks, for example, they cannot use the script to only create a configuration file and skip other steps. 
 	4. Configuration files don't have enough comments, [leading to confusion](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2655#issuecomment-1465731661) when users try to change it manually.
  5. Only Docker-based installation is listed in our docs. But [Users want to install Mathesar without using Docker](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35007769)
  6. The docker-compose file is [complex](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/11n2fxx/comment/jbnmdvi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)



## Solution
- [Add Documentation for setting up Mathesar with the Mathesar Service Docker Image](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2783). Fixes Problem[a]
- [Add Documentation for installing Mathesar without using install.sh](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2761). Fixes Problem[b] and [c]
- [Documenting our config files so user can manually edit them](/en/projects/installation-documentation-improvements)https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2784). Fixes Problem[d]
- [Documenting setting up Mathesar without Docker](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2427). Fixes Problem[e]
- [Document upgrade instructions for non-docker-compose environments](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2785)
- [Document limitations involved with the installation script](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2787). Auxiallary fix for Problem[b] and [c]
- [Separate docker-compose file for production](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2788). Fixes Problem[f]

## Risks
- There are unknowns with testing since weâ€™re hiring external people, which might affect the timeline.
- Issues uncovered during testing might affect the timeline.

## Resources
- **Issues**: [GitHub meta issue](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2789)

## Timeline
This project should take **3 weeks** for the features to be implemented, tested, reviewed and additionally **1 week** for final testing, so **4 weeks** in total. Testing will start happening in  parallel as soon as a documentation gets completed.
