**Name**: Research: Publicly shareable links
**Status**: Complete
**Follow up**: [Shareable links implementation project](/en/projects/shareable-links-implementation)

## Team
| Role | Assignee |
|-|-|-|
| **Owner** | Pavish |

## Problem
* We have the following features in our roadmap:
	- [Ability to share tables and explorations](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/2266)
  - [Embed tables and explorations in other websites](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/2265)
* We require a well defined plan at the product level to begin implementation level analysis of the initial version of these features.

## Solution
* Research approaches in competing products.
* Come up with UX flow suggestions.
* Come up with a preliminary backend and frontend approach to validate feasibility of the features.
* Adjust scope to the minimal useful initial version of these features. 
* Write up a product spec and go through review, iterations, and approval from the team.
* Once the product spec is approved, write up a new project for implementating the features.

## Timeline
This project should take **5 days**, subject to possible delay due to review feedback and iterations.
