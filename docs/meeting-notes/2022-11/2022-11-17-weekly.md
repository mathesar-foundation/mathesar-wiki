## Throw targeted error message for columns no longer present in the Query

We're having some disagreements regarding [#1905](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/pull/1905); specifically, what information we want to convey about queries whose dependency columns or tables are missing; [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/xHb5oIqye3fnXtb2heRH34/Styling?node-id=1616%3A26083&t=cSc0V77g2fZ0e4sM-0) is showing a list of columns that are missing from the query. But Mukesh wants to show a warning(using dependency graph UI) right when a column referenced by a query is deleted instead of throwing up an error after the column is deleted. Since a dependency graph is not feasible  right now, can we settle for showing up only the one deleted column at a time as it is much easier on the backend?

### Decision
- We shouldn't spend a lot of time figuring out one error message, we have bigger priorities
- We'll proceed with showing one column only for now
    - Ghislaine will adjust error message in Figma design
    - We recognize this isn't optimal UX - we would like users to have a one-click recovery option
        - Mukesh will create issue to track improving error recovery for users, we can prioritize this separately

## Style duplication between django templates and svelte code

**Attendees**: Pavish, Sean, Rajat

**Summary**: We would want to use styles defined in our svelte side of the frontend, in the login page. We might also want to place the live demo banner on the django templates. This discussion is regarding the benefits of using django templates for these and overlooking the style duplication for now, or whether we should move these to svelte instead.

### Decision
- The frontend team is okay with the duplication, since it'll be quite minimal.
- We will continue using django templates for the login page and banner.

## Users and permissions for production
- **Attendees**: Brent, Kriti, Ghislaine, Mukesh, Dom (partial)

Brent has concerns about our expectations and assumptions about what we mean by "production environment", and how far we want to go with the Django-managed permissions model

### Notes
- We're relying on our permissions to make sure that users can't perform DDL operations
- Postgres permissions are much more battle-tested than the Django permissions in our product
- We're requiring root access to the database during setup, so the user will only depend on our code to make sure unexpected DDL operations don't happen
    - We're still an alpha product
    - We don't want to lose or unexpectedly change user data
- We should set expectations / warnings appropriately in our documentation
- Mukesh also has concerns about our long term plan of "bundling" Postgres permissions within our user roles, but since that plan is still ill-defined and not blocking anything, we decided not to discuss it right now.

### Decision
- We'll proceed with our current permission model
- We've added the following to our first release requirements:
    - Document how to set up Mathesar with a "no DDL" user so that DDL operations are not even possible
    - We may also want to document how to set up Mathesar with a read only user
    - The frontend should disable the appropriate options when Mathesar is set up without full access to the database.
        - We'll do some testing.

## Data sets discussion
- **Attendees**: Brent, Kriti, Ghislaine, Mukesh

We need to decide what data sets we'll have in the live demo. This also affects website work since we have a "use cases" section on the website homepage.

### Brainstorming
- Library management
    - purpose: show inventory management and managing rentals
- "Academics" data set
    - purpose: show off Mathesar technical features (self-referential FKs)
- Event planning data set
    - Speakers, talks, rooms, tracks
    - Make explorations for "first day speakers", "room A schedule", "everyone talking during time B"
- Project management + CRM data set
    - Task: description, start date, due date, completed, assignee
    - Projects with deadlines
    - Tasks can belong to Projects
    - Exploration: non-completed tasks
- Movie collection and rating
    - Showcase hobby related data set
- GPT labeling use case?
    - Mukesh will make an example schema for this before we decide
- Calorie tracking app
    - Would be useful for a large set of people
    - Would be good to have calculated columns in the future
- No expense tracking (we don't have calculated fields, not clear how we can demonstrate that it's better than a spreadsheet)
    - Potentially add in the future
- In the future, we should push that it's a "unified" interface that combines CRM and event planning and payroll and whatnot (run your entire business database)
- UI for data populated by script â€“ e.g. price tracker or something
    - The purpose would be to showcase Mathesar as a UI for data in Postgres
- Roster - grades, teachers, students, absentee
- Disaster preparedness
    - Resources for where to get things like food etc.
    - We should do this once we have Location data type

Not sure if we should do project management since it's so common and there are a lot of specialized software for it, Mathesar might not look good. Roster might be better

### Decisions
Prioritized list of data sets.
- Library management system
- Movie collection 
    - Can base it on CC0 dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
    - Please don't use JSON fields, we don't have a good UI for them yet, convert them into relational data
- Event planning - conference
    - Might be cute to do "MathesarCon", talk names can reference our features 
    - Kriti can help with copy if needed
- "UI for data entered outside Mathesar" (price tracker or something similar)
    - Maybe use https://zapier.com/apps/postgresql/integrations (make it friendly for non-technical users)
- Calorie tracking
- Roster data set

Even just the top 4 would be great.

Deprioritized "academics data set" since demo use cases should be based around use cases
