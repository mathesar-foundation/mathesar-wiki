**Attendees**: Core team, Anish, Anshuman

*We talked about Mathesar funding and strategy for the first half of the meeting, those meeting notes are not public. Core team members can find them in HackMD.*

## New team workflow
We're going back to fixed length cycles.

- We'll do 4 week cycles with 2 week breaks.
- Each cycle will have projects
	- That means projects will be 4 weeks, and should be scoped accordingly.
        - If concerned, reduce scope.
	- The projects system will remain the same â€“ the only difference is that timelines will be restricted to 4 weeks.
	- We need to make sure that individual team members are not overcommitted and each project has the resources it needs.
    - Each person should be owning only one project
    - Participating in at most 2 others.
- We'll be using breaks to:
	- have a retrospective
	- release Mathesar
        - Testing
        - bugfixes for found problems
	- plan and approve the next round of projects
	- consider rotating ongoing responsibilities
- This means releases will happen every 6 weeks.
	- We should figure out how to speed this up in the future, but for now, let's at least get a standard schedule going.
- Next cycle starts on July 10.
- For community work, we need to make sure we leave enough buffer to deal with community PRs and mentoring.

## Project approval process
Projects for the next cycle will be discussed and approved at core team meetings during breaks.

*We ran out of time and will continue talking on Thursday.*
