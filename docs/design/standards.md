# Casing

- Use **Title Case** for:
    - Page titles
    - Tab titles
    - Modal titles
    - Toast titles
    - Headings
    - Buttons
    - Menu items
    - Dropdown triggers

- Use **Sentence case** for:
    - Form field labels
    - Field set legends
    - Radio options
    - Select options
    - Tool tips
    - Help text
    - Pagination
    - Image alt text

# Placement and positioning

- Buttons which move the user "forward" should be placed to the right of buttons which move the user "backwards". For example, if a modal dialog has buttons for "Cancel" and "Submit", "Cancel" should be on the left and "Submit" should be on the right.
