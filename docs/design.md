This is the homepage for Mathesar design work, closely related to [Product](/product) and [Engineering](/engineering).

# Documents
Outputs of our design process.

- [:sailboat: Exploration *Rough notes for initial research and discovery*](/design/exploration)
- [:spiral_notepad: Reports *Conclusions drawn after research*](/design/reports)

# Workflow
Design tasks are [tracked on GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22work%3A+design%22) and are closely tied to our [Roadmap](/product/roadmap). 

We aim to complete design work for a milestone at least 2-3 weeks before the deadline to allow sufficient time for implementation. Design is usually at a couple of milestones ahead of backend work.
