## Solution

### Supabase

*Why?*: Postgres-specificity + reach + potential for discoverability.

- The [Supabase partner integration page](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations) should include Mathesar. 
- Our documentation should link to the Supabase integration and an accompanying guide about how to use Supabase with Mathesar.
	- Also review docs for how well it explains RLS, how to set up a DB without allowing DDL changes, and how to set up roles and permissions.
- We should publish a blog post about how to set up RLS in Supabase / Postgres generally and use it with Mathesar.
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the Supabase specific items as well as generally.

Example: [Directus's Supabase integration](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/directus) shows how to demonstrate integration with a self-hosted project.

*Maps to use case: Frances*  
*Maps to category: Hosted Postgres / backend services*

### Helm chart

*Why?*: Integrates into existing infrastructure, user requests.

- Users should be able to install Mathesar via a Helm chart. available in a repo.  
	- Potentially multiple types of helm charts based on structure. 
- Our documentation should link to those charts as a first class citizen in the installation section, with accompanying documentation on how to use them.
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the Helm specific items as well as generally.

*Maps to use case: Frances*  
*Maps to category: DevOps tools*

### DigitalOcean

*Why?*: Quick implementation time, helps people evaluate, makes Mathesar deployment accessible without CLI.

- Users should be able to find and install Mathesar in the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/) as a [one-click app](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/droplet-1-click-apps/). 
- Our documentation should include deploying with Digital Ocean as a first class citizen in the installation section, with accompanying documentation on how to work with it.
	- The user should be able to complete the setup without ever using the command line or having to make any decisions about database size, SSL, etc.
	- The setup should take less than 15 minutes and produce a working HTTPS endpoint with a login screen.
	- We need to be able to help non-technical users find their organization‚Äôs existing DB and connect it to Mathesar in the UI or docs. We can‚Äôt assume as much technical familiarity when they‚Äôre doing a one-click deploy.
- Our README and documentation should include a [one-click deploy button](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/one-click-deploy-button).
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the Digital Ocean specific items as well as generally.

*Maps to use case: Blair*  
*Maps to category: Simple platforms*

### Railway

*Why?*: Quick implementation time, helps people evaluate, makes Mathesar deployment accessible without CLI.

- Users should be able to find and install Mathesar on [Railway](https://railway.com/) as a [one-click app](https://railway.com/deploy). 
- Our documentation should include deploying with Railway as a first class citizen in the installation section, with accompanying documentation on how to work with it.
- Our README and documentation should include a [one-click deploy button](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/one-click-deploy-button).
	- We need to be able to help non-technical users find their organization‚Äôs existing DB and connect it to Mathesar in the UI or docs. We can‚Äôt assume as much technical familiarity when they‚Äôre doing a one-click deploy.
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the Railway specific items as well as generally.

*Maps to use case: Drew*  
*Maps to category: Simple platforms, Developer-focused PaaS*

### Cloudron

*Why?*: Works for self-hosters, expanding platform diversity.

- Users should be able to find and install Mathesar through [Cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io/).
- Our documentation should include deploying with Cloudron as a first class citizen in the installation section, with accompanying documentation on how to work with it.
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the Cloudron specific items as well as generally.

*Maps to use case: Isa*  
*Maps to category: Self-hosted PaaS*

### Fly.io

*Why?*: Expands platform diversity to more developer-focused tooling.

- Our documentation should include a guide to deploying with fly.io as a first class citizen in the installation section, with accompanying documentation on how to work with it.
- We should track analytics of how much traffic and clicks all this is generating, both for the fly.io specific items as well as generally.

*Maps to use case: Casey*  
*Maps to category: Developer-focused PaaS*

### Google Cloud Platform

*Why?*: Big Three cloud infrastructure platform, expands platform diversity.

- Users should be able to find and install Mathesar through the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en).
- We should write guides for how to set up Mathesar with GCP, such that they are foolproof to follow and follow GCP best practices and networking.
	- Using CloudSQL
	- Using Helm + GKE
	- Using a VM

*Maps to use case: Gray*  
*Maps to category: Cloud IaaS*

---

*We will evaluate what‚Äôs next for this project after we complete implementation of the above, based on our current user base and the efficacy of all the things we've already done.* 

## Tradeoffs

These issues came up in the user stories below, but we're not prioritizing them.

* Updating UI documentation with screenshots for people to use to train other people.
	* Too much work; too unrelated to this project.
* AWS *and* GCP
	* We should only start with one here since it‚Äôll be a lot of work.
	* Depends on what our users use more.
* Anything to do with the use cases of:
	* Harper, on-premise engineer.
	* John, Mac user.
	* Elliot: AWS user (unless we substitute him for Gray and do AWS instead of GCP).

Things to watch out for while implementing:

* Not making installation methods easily discoverable in our documentation. See [Self-hosting](https://nocodb.com/docs/self-hosting) (NocoDB) and [Install with Docker](https://baserow.io/docs/installation%2Finstall-with-docker) (Baserow, see sidebar) for positive examples.
* Trying to make our documentation too preemptively perfect ‚Äì let‚Äôs just put it out there.
* Not implementing things because of prioritizing hypothetical maintainability concerns, or not imagining that something might be useful, or worrying about cluttering the documentation (these have all come up in the past).
* Spending a lot of time stuck on one installation method without raising it / figuring out if we should keep going.


## High-Level Implementation Plan

**Work needed**: Backend & documentation work, primarily.

**Implementers and reviewers**:

Brent & Anish to implement, Kriti reviews user-facing or admin-facing changes as they are merged.

**Rough timeline:** 1 type completed per week.

### NocoDB

For what it‚Äôs worth, NocoDB supports a few different types of hosting platforms, see all types below in the next section.

**‚ÄúAuto upstall‚Äù:** This is their default script meant for a Linux server that installs everything including Postgres, sets up a DB, sets up SSL, upgrades, etc. I think it‚Äôs meant to be idempotentent.

**Simple platforms:** Digital Ocean, Railway, some other ‚Äúone click deploy‚Äù buttons.

**Cloud marketplaces:** AWS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run

**DevOps tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Helm chart

**Local installation:** Homebrew, Nix/NixOS, npm

**Self-hosted PaaS tools:** Cloudron, CapRover \+ they link to an external TrueNAS / FreeNAS guide.

### Baserow

Baserow supports a similar list of hosting services as NocoDB.

**DevOps tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Helm chart, K8S. They have images that contain all dependencies and are ready to go.

**Simple platforms:** Digital Ocean, Heroku, Render, Railway \+ a page for other third-party hosting providers

**Cloud marketplaces:** AWS Fargate / other ways of deploying on AWS using Docker & Kubernetes

**Self-hosted PaaS tools:** Cloudron

Additionally, they have:

- Guides on how to set up various proxies: Traefix, nginx, Apache  
- A guide on how to set up logging and monitoring  
- A guide on how to save files securely

## Community Engagement

We should:

- seek input from community members who have asked for additional deployment options, to ensure that we're building the right set of features and addressing their use cases.
- set up a Community Guides section of our docs so that we can ask people to contribute their setups.
- update our blog with every new guide we write, even if it also goes on our documentation website.
- consider updating website copy with each new deployment method.
- consider posting on platform-specific or self-hosting communities when we add a new platform.
- consider adding one-click buttons to our website.
