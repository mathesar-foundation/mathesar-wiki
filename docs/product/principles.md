# Product

These principles apply to _what_ Mathesar is.

- Mathesar should be able to work as a frontend to existing databases without altering data, even if not all features are available.
- Mathesar is built in a modular way, so that:
	- Our database helper library should be able to be used independently of using Mathesar.
  - Mathesar's backend should support building custom frontend/mobile clients. All actions should be available via API, and should be well documented.
  - Mathesar should support plugins for custom data types, views, data manipulations, etc.
- Mathesar's frontend should have an intuitive, user-friendly, and delightful user interface
  - Our aim is to make users feel empowered to explore, make mistakes, and recover from them.
- Mathesar is for both non-technical and technical users.
  - We favor [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) (sensible defaults).
  - Users do not need to know anything about database concepts to use Mathesar, but we do not hide them either.
  - We aim to actively guide non-technical users into using Mathesar (and databases in general) optimally.
  - We aim to create a standard PostgreSQL database that technical users can use with other PostgreSQL tooling.

# Process

These principles apply to _how_ we build Mathesar.

- Documentation is meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive.
  - Our aim is to write down what we need to make things easier for ourselves.
  - Avoid rabbit holes (defining/planning out too far into the future), keep focus on getting a product out.
- Iterate, don't try to get things perfect.
  - We are trying to make something that we can put in front of users _quickly_.
  - We might have to change or throw away stuff later, that is absolutely fine.
- Keep implementation simple.
  - Try to minimize assumptions about users, we cannot know what users want ahead of time.
  - Given two options, if both rely on assumptions about users, choose the one that's simpler to implement.
