# Proposal review process

### Definitions

* **Blocker**: Critical issue that causes lasting harm to the project or contributors.
  * **Fixable Blocker**: Addressable through proposal revision.
  * **Unworkable Blocker**: Requires entirely new proposal.

### Review Process Overview

Proposals undergo a loosely-structured two-week review cycle:

* **Clarification and Initial Feedback (Synchronous project planning team call or 2-3 days of async review, at most)**
  * Participants (reviewers and the author) clarify the proposal’s intent and scope by asking questions and leaving comments.
  * Reviewers provide initial feedback, identify potential blockers early, and acknowledge strengths.
  * Authors limit revisions to minor editorial changes until both reviewers have responded.
* **Revision (up to 1 week)**
  * Authors incorporate feedback and address identified blockers.
  * Authors communicate the revision timeline clearly to participants.
  * Sync meetings, calls, or discussions may be used to reach consensus on approaches.
  * **This should almost always be the longest and most intensive part of the process.**
* **Decision (1-2 days max)**
  * Participants assess the revised proposal to decide on implementation readiness.
  * Objective blockers (user harm, legal, impossible, prohibitively expensive) are prioritized; subjective concerns are considered carefully but kept manageable.
  * Participants determine collaboratively whether blockers are fixable or unworkable.
* **Iterative Resolution (Remaining day(s), if needed)**
  * If fixable blockers exist, authors and participants revise collaboratively.
  * Repeats as needed, ensuring all blockers are addressed or clearly marked unworkable by end of the cycle.
* **Approval or Tabling**
  * **Approval**: Proposal approved once all blockers resolved; implementation tasks initiated.
  * **Tabling**: Unworkable blockers result in tabling the proposal and writing a new one.

### Guidelines

* Participants communicate promptly about availability to maintain the process efficiency.
* Focus on trust, teamwork, and continuous improvement.
* Default to async communication for initial thoughts; use sync meetings and calls strategically to achieve consensus.
* At any point the process can be “short-cut” to immediate approval if consensus is reached by reviewers.
