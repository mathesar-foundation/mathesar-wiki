# Guide
This section serves as a handbook for people working on these responsibilities.

## All members
- Everyone should be on the `marketing@mathesar.org` mailing list.
  - This list receives the “firehose” of Syften notifications, including all mentions of competitors and people looking for “spreadsheet-like” solutions.
- Analytics and Twitter credentials are in 1Password.

## Owner
- Make progress on our [Mathesar launch publicity checklist](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-website/issues/78), delegate tasks as needed.
    - We’ll hold off on making new announcements until our installation process is improved
- Manage changes to Mathesar.org, delegate tasks as needed.
- Review all external comms.

## Social media helpers

### Respond to Syften notifications
Syften notifications are auto-assigned to the "Marketing" group in Freshdesk. Please close the ticket in Freshdesk once a notification has been handled or if there is nothing to do.

- **If Mathesar is mentioned**:
	- Post mentions in the `Mathesar - Marketing` Matrix channel.
  - Decide if a response is needed.
  - Compose a response (or if needed, ask the owner to compose a response).
  	- Responses should be aimed at thanking people, addressing people's concerns, and/or answering questions.
    - Responses should people to existing conversations, issues, and discussions as much as possible.
  - Get approval from the owner before posting the response.
    - This approval requirement will be removed once we have better guidelines for responding to people.
- **If someone mentions a problem that Mathesar could be used to solve**:
  - Compose a response (or if needed, ask the owner to compose a response).
    - Responses should suggest using Mathesar in a tactful way.
    - Our goal here should not be to shoehorn Mathesar into all sorts of use cases. Instead, we should be on the lookout only for cases that Mathesar is a good solution for.
  - Get approval from the owner before posting the response.
    - This approval requirement will be removed once we have better guidelines for responding to people.
- **If Mathesar is mentioned on Twitter**: 
  - Re-tweet it from our account and/or thank them for the shoutout.
  - Only re-tweet if the tweet appears to be from a real person or organization. Do not re-tweet bot accounts (e.g. "First Issues Bot").
- **If a comment or post can be considered user feedback**:
  - Please flag it to the owner of the [user feedback](/en/team/responsibilities/user-feedback) responsibility.

### Document noteworthy publicity
- Keep track of where we’re getting traffic from (using Syften, GitHub Insights and our analytics), and track notable sources in the [Marketing History](./marketing/history.md) page
- Also post noteworthy publicity to the `Mathesar - Marketing` channel on Matrix.

### Make release announcements
Release announcements should include highlights from release notes. We should avoid the announcements following a template because people tend to ignore repetitive things.

- Post a message in the `Mathesar - General` channel on Matrix announcing the release
- Post a message to the developers and users mailing lists announcing the release
- Tweet when we publish a new release
- *TODO: also figure out where / how to post on Reddit for new releases*

## Website helpers
- Implement changes to the website as requested by the owner.

## Aggregation helpers
- Add Mathesar to aggregators (tracked [in this issue](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-website/issues/84)).
  - Feel free to ask the owner to review any copy written for this.
- Do research on more relevant aggregators that Mathesar could be added to and add them to the issue.

# Notes & Resources
- See [Marketing](/en/marketing) section of the wiki.
- Eventually, the plan is to create an “evangelism guide” ([example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/social-media/))
