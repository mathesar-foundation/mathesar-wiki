# User help

**Owner**: Kriti
**Helpers**: Brent, Pavish, Sean

## Maintenance tasks

- Ensure that someone from the core team responds to user communication promptly and follows up with action items as needed.
    - Channels:
        - GitHub Issues
        - GitHub discussions
        - Matrix (the Users & General channels are most likely to receive messages)
        - Email from `hello [at] mathesar [dot] org` (in Freshdesk)
        - Installation request forms (in Freshdesk)
- Ensure that someone is responsible for following up promptly for all user communications
- Flags user feedback to the owner of the [user feedback](/team/responsibilities/user-feedback) responsibility.

### Principles

- User help is the highest priority
- Treat users like gold
- Do work ourselves so that they don't have to do work (e.g. spend time reproducing their setup, etc.)

## Higher-level tasks

- Find additional users for Mathesar proactively and help them
- Figure out how to improve communication with users (both quantity and quality)
