# Working on
- Catching up with email / GitHub / Matrix backlog from time off.

## Backlog

- Also go through General channel feedback and create issues or other follow ups
- Review Sean's Querydown document
- Figure out a "backlog grooming" process and go through and organize GitHub issues and milestones

- Figure out guidelines to write better issues.
- Figure out how to write up and communicate a better public product roadmap.
- Ensure our team workflow is up to date on the wiki
