# Team Events

The Mathesar core team has a virtual team event around every two weeks to have some fun and get to know each other better. Team members take turns organizing events on a volunteer basis.

Previous events have included:

- Watching a movie together using [Syncplay](https://syncplay.pl/). 
- Playing [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) both collaboratively and competitively.
- Playing trivia competitively (in teams) on [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/).
- Playing an online escape room together.
- Playing an online drawing/guessing game on [skribbl](https://skribbl.io/).
- A murder mystery roleplay event.
- Lightning Talks
- Playing [CodeNames](https://codenames.game/)
- Playing charades (with a movie theme)
- Playing an online version of [Fishbowl](https://fishbowl-game.com/), a guessing game.
- Playing [just one!](https://just1.herokuapp.com/)
- Playing https://really.boring.website
- Playing [Quack Stanley](https://quackstanley.net/)

We're particularly interested in events that help us get to know each other better. Also, we're always open to doing activities we've done before.
