Issues should only be assigned to core and community team members who have committed to completing the issue.

If an outside contributor wants to work on the issue, they should still comment on it to indicate interest, but there's no need to assign it to them.

If you are assigning an issue:

1. Ensure that the issue has sufficient detail and can be worked on. If not, update the issue so that it does.
2. Assign the issue to the desired person.
3. Remove the existing `status: ready` label and change the label to `status: started`. This will automatically update the "Status" in the project as well, you do not need to do this manually.
