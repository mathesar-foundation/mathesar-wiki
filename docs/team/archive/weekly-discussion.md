At the beginning of each week, we start a discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions) to review Mathesar's progress, provide updates to the community, and to check in about our process and workload. Everyone is welcome to add a new topic to discuss or to comment on existing topics.

Core team members are required to participate, others are welcome.

All weekly discussions [can be found here](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/categories/planning).

## Posting a Discussion

Quick notes on posting discussions. This is usually Kriti's responsibility, but other people on the core team might need to post discussions sometimes if Kriti is unavailable.

- Create a new discussion in the `Planning` category.
- Set the label to `status: draft` when you are constructing the discussion.
- Make sure to link back to each top-level topic from the main topic.
- Set the label to `status: started` when the discussion is ready for contribution. Post to the `General` channel on Matrix saying the discussion is up.
- Once the discussion is complete, set the label to `status: done`.
