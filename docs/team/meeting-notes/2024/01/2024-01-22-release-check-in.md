# 2024-01-22 QA testing meeting 

## General notes

- Infra: we'll set it up and tear it down soon afterwards
- Do we want separate database servers for everyone?
    - We'll use a single server for testing. We'll all prefix our database names with our own names, e.g. `sean_mathesar`
- Brent will set up a DB server separate from our internal server
- What pre-existing data should we have in place before upgrading?
    - lots of stuff going on in Django, e.g. Explorations
    - What can go wrong? Migrations, losing the connection between the service in its upgraded state and the correct user database â€” anything that would prevent the service layer from connecting to the internal DB.
- Kriti: Do we really need to test all these different combinations?
    - Brent: We need to encourage people to move to our own latest Docker compose setup. If they've rolled their own then that's fine, but if they're running an older docker-compose setup, then they need to change their setup.
- How aggressive do we want to be with changes for upgrades?
    - We'd like to suggest that users ask us for help if they run into trouble upgrading
    - It's okay if we cause users some pain right now
    - It's okay if users lose their explorations or other metadata. We can recommend that users contact us if they really need their explorations
- Who is going to write the upgrade instructions within the release notes?
    - Brent
- Where is the source of truth for release notes?
    - docs.mathesar.org, with each release as its own page
- Where is the source of truth for upgrade documentation?
    - in a section within the release notees page

## TODO

- We need to remove the upgrade system from the UI
    - This needs to become a "nag", with no button.
    - Should redirect to docs
    - **Sean** will do this
- Installation testing can happen now
    - Pavish, Sean, Kriti will work on this
- **Sean** will do some pairing with Adam on UI testing
- **Ghislaine** will go through library demo script
- **Ghislaine** will also test new testing steps for Explorations added by Pavish
- **Anish** will also work on testing
- **Brent** working on docs changes
- **Anish** will begin working on installation videos
- **Sean** will put release notes in docs
