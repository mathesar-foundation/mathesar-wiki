### Notes

- This is an update on the work that Kriti and Ghislaine have been doing.
- Nothing yet is "finished". Want feedback and thoughts as project continues.
- Kriti and Ghislaine have been approaching it separately.
    - Kriti: high-level product strategy and goals
    - Ghislaine: looking through all the data we've collected on what kinds of problems people use data tooling to solve. Figuring out trends so that we can get to personas.
- We had a persona for our launch last year. We're seeking five personas to define right now
- We're not seeking decisions today. Not seeking synchronous discussion. Just presentation, discussion can be async.

### Presentation from Ghislaine

- We've been looking through public comments that we've noticed from Syften
- We're documenting specific "use cases", with a bunch of detail about each one
    - [Documented here](https://hackmd.io/wC38kFL-Q6mR2TJR2_ZCEw)
- Data extracted from these use cases is being stored in Mathesar in the [User Research schema](https://internal.mathesar.org/db/mathesar_tables/14/)
- Also looking at industry blogs and job postings
- All this data will form the basis of the user personas that we're defining
- Ghislaine will provide more info to us later (via a wiki page) about how we can collaboratively add data to her set of "use cases" data
- Pavish: how do we prioritize use cases?
    - we'll use the strategy to help with prioritization (Kriti's work)
- Brent: concerned that the categorization scheme might be too ridgid and might steer us towards assumptions based on the scheme. Need to be careful to avoid confirmation bias
    - Kriti: Ghislaine pulled the categories from the use cases, not the other way around. We'll also have a process for inputting new use cases and re-evaluating the categories.


### Presentation from Kriti

- We'll try to have some discussion about this async
- We'll continue seeking some decisions on the niche at next week's meeting
