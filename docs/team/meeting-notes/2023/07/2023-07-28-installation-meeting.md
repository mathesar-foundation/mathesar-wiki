## Pre-meeting prep
Please read the following proposed outline for the documentation

### Assumptions (for the reader; not part of outline)
- Users are comfortable with self-hosting, we do not need to educate them on self-hosting basics
- For PaaS
  - Considered to be used for production, so all best practices like using Postgres as internal db, env variables are used by default

### Environment Variables
List of environment variables and descriptions

### Connecting to DBs on localhost
This will explain how to connect to localhost DBs if you're using Docker (content is already on docs.mathesar.org)

### Stuff we're removing from current docs (not part of outline)
- Guided script installation
    - plus appendices
- Docker compose installation
    - plus "customizing docker compose" page
- Install from scratch --> renamed to "Install on Debian"
- Administration section (uninstall & upgrade Mathesar)
    - Will be folded into individual installation types

## Agenda

### Do the personas make sense? Do we need any additional narrowing down or clarification?

Top

- Someone trying Mathesar out quickly (and can use Docker)
- Someone installing Mathesar on a PaaS
- Someone installing server & DB on same remote system
    - Using Docker
    - Using Debian, but not Docker
    - Using some other flavor of Linux
- Someone installing server & DB on separate remote systems
    - same as above

Medium

- Someone installing server on localhost, but connecting to a remote DB
- Someone installing Mathesar on existing DevOps infrastructure
    - Helm, Kubernetes goes here

Not prioritizing at all - until more than one person asks

- Ansible / other automation guides
- Someone installing Mathesar on a remote system that's not Linux
- Someone who wants to build Mathesar from source
- Someone trying Mathesar out quickly locally (and cannot use Docker)

Discourage

- Someone installing everything on localhost (not just trying it out)

#### Additional discussion
- What about people using load balancers?
    - This is outside Mathesar's purview, doesn't matter
    - PaaS probably covers load balancers anyway

#### Conclusion
Personas are fine, see additional detail added above.

### Does the proposed outline make sense?

#### Discussion
- "Install with Python binary" is a confusing header.
    - Maybe use "Install from binary"?
    - Maybe replace with PyPI installation?
        - This could lead to Python installation issues
        - Virtualenv needs to be set up
    - The persona we're trying to serve here is "someone installing on remote Linux server, non-Debian, non-Docker"
    - Are zipapps the best solution for this persona?
    - Brent & Kriti agree that they would probably ignore zipapps when consuming installation docs because they're not familiar
    - Lots of FUD about broken Python installs
    - We need to support a wider band of Python, `pip install` will work better
    - Synapse PyPI instructions: https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html#installing-as-a-python-module-from-pypi
    - Conclusion: We'll replace this with "Install using PyPI"
    - We'll no longer be working on zipapps unless there's demonstrable user need in the future
- What we're removing:
    - Fine with removing Docker Compose & guided script
    - Might be useful to keep uninstallation & update in the sidebar
        - We'll keep the uninstall and update pages


### What work do we need to do to enable this outline?
- Get Mathesar working with a wide band of Python
- Create a Debian package
- Create a PyPI package
- We need to know what Postgres we support
- Move user DB management to the database, encrypted by secret key
    - Design work, UI work
- Helm chart work
- Superuser creation moved to the UI â€“ already underway
- Make complete Docker image
- Figure out as a team how we want to manage our DockerHub repo and tags
    - There are a bunch of different strategies
- Reassess Docker version requirements once we do a single Docker image
    - We only have a stringent version requirement because of Docker Compose, which we don't plan to use 
- Building static files
    - If it's possible to build static files as part of the release assets in e.g. https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/releases/tag/0.1.2, we should do that
    - Single source of truth for release assets
    - Debian package and PyPI can use this single source of truth
- Secret key generation
    - Docker should do this
    - Debian - post install script
    - Where should it live?
- Storing configuration
    - Do we want to even provide a Django settings file in our repo?
    - We ran out of time at this point
- Permissions
    - Should we create a DB automatically?
    - No time to discuss now

Mukesh will start separate email threads to discuss:

- Configuration
- Permissions

We'll try to get to a decision async and if we reach an impasse, we can set up another meeting.
