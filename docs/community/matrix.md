# Mathesar on Matrix

For realtime chat, we use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) *(similar to Slack, Discord, Mattermost, Zulip, etc)*.

## Joining
1. To start, join our ["General" Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#mathesar:matrix.mathesar.org).
    - When prompted to "Choose an app to continue", select "Element".
    - If you're new to Matrix, you'll need to create an account. If you already have a Matrix account, you can use it here, even if that account is hosted on a different Matrix homeserver.
1. If you want to use a desktop or mobile app, we recommend installing [Element](https://element.io/get-started). There are [other clients](https://matrix.org/clients/) too.
1. The "General" channel that you've just joined is for high-level discussion and announcements about the project. Most of our day to day discussion happens in other channels. Look through the list of rooms below and join the ones for topics you're interested.

> **Note:** If you're a GSoC aspirant, join our ["Mathesar - Mentoring Programs" Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#mentoring:matrix.mathesar.org) and introduce yourself there instead of in the "General" channel.
