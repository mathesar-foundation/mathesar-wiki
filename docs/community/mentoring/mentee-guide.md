This guide is for accepted mentees. If you are an applicant, read our [Applicant Guide](/en/community/mentoring/applicant-guide).

## Post-Announcement

Program acceptance announcements have been made and you've been selected! Congratulations! Here's what we expect you to do before the program period officially starts:
- Continue to refine your project plan and timeline with your mentors.
- Define communication channels and set up a weekly check-in with your mentor.
- Set up your computer and development environment.
- Read through our [Team Guide](/en/team/guide) and familiarize yourself with our workflow and development process.
- Introduce yourself to [core team](/en/team/members).

## Program Period

Once the program starts, here's what we expect of you:

- Work 30-40 hours per week (or agree on a different plan with your mentor ahead of time).
- Push code to GitHub frequently. Commit early and often.
- Be available on Matrix whenever you are working.
- Attend your weekly check-in with your mentor and any other meetings.
- Be proactive about asking for help, especially when you're stuck.
- Ensure that you're on track to delivering your project at the end of the work period. If you're not on track, talk with your mentor to come up with a new plan for the project well before the deadline.
-  Let your mentor and the organization admins know when you are going to be unavailable. If something sudden comes up, let us know.
