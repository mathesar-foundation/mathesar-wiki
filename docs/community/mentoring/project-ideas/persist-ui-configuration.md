* Work with the Mathesar backend and frontend teams to finalize the specifications.
* Implement the necessary backend work.
* Implement the frontend work to send API requests when user modifies any of these configurations.

## Expected Outcome
* Users' changes to the UI should be persisted as described in "The Problem" section.

## Application Tips
* Show proficiency in the required skills.
* Provide a preliminary approach to solving the challenge, including the database schema and API specifications.
* Demonstrate a good understanding of the Mathesar codebase.
