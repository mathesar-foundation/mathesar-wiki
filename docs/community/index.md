# Community Forums
The Mathesar team does most of our work in public communication channels, which also serve as the place we interact with our community. We also sometimes attend events.

- [:speech_balloon: Matrix *Primary real-time chat*](/en/community/matrix)
- [:speech_balloon: Discord *Alternate chat (limited rooms)*](/en/community/discord)
- [:computer: GitHub *Code, issue tracking, and asynchronous discussions*](/en/community/github)
- [:envelope: Mailing Lists *Email lists for users and developers*](/en/community/mailing-lists)
- [:beers: Events *Events attended by the Mathesar team*](/en/community/events)

# Future Plans
Some ideas we're considering in the future to grow the community:
- Setting up events, such as office hours, pair programming sessions, or even livestreaming our work.
- An end-user focused Matrix channel
- A way for users to vote on [Roadmap](/product/roadmap) items.

Let us know if you have more ideas!
