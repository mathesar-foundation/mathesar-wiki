# Mathesar Community

Welcome to the Mathesar community! We'd love to have you involved in our project, as a contributor, a user or both! Please join our community forums and talk to us there.

If you're interesting in contributing, see [Contributing](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Community Channels

The Mathesar team does most of our work in public communication channels, which also serve as the place we interact with our community. We also sometimes attend events.

| Channel                             | Purpose |
| --                                  | -- |
| [GitHub](./github.md)               | Code, issue tracking, and asynchronous discussions |
| [Mailing Lists](./mailing-lists.md) | Email lists for users and developers |
| [Matrix](./matrix.md)               | Primary real-time chat |
| [Discord](./discord.md)             | Alternate chat (limited rooms) |

## Future Plans

Some ideas we're considering in the future to grow the community:

- Setting up events, such as office hours, pair programming sessions, or even livestreaming our work.
- An end-user focused Matrix channel
- A way for users to vote on [Roadmap](../product/roadmap.md) items.

Let us know if you have more ideas!

## Resources
- The [GitLab Community Relations handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/) might be useful reading for how to approach growing our community.
