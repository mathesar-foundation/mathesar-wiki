The Mathesar team uses GitHub for code, issue tracking, and long form (asynchronous) discussions. We also have our roadmap here.

## Repositories
- The [Mathesar code](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar) is our main repository.
- The [Mathesar wiki repository](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-wiki) is the content for this wiki. Content can either be edited directly in the repository or through the wiki's web interface.
- The [Mathesar website repository](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-website) is the repository for `mathesar.org`. It uses Jekyll and is deployed on GitHub Pages.
- The [Mathesar data playground repository](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-data-playground) is used for data sets and other data related projects.
- The [Mathesar design prototype repository](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-design) is used by the design team to prototype upcoming feature designs for Mathesar. We don't actively use this, as of Aug 2022.
- We have forked [sqlalchemy-filters](https://github.com/centerofci/sqlalchemy-filters) to add some functionality.

## Issue Tracking & Roadmap
- [Mathesar repo milestones](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open):  we track our roadmap using GitHub milestones
- We use GitHub issues across all our repositories to track work. Most of our issues are located [on our main repo](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues).

## GitHub Discussions

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions) for asynchronous conversations. We discuss code, design, and plan work here.

Please introduce yourself in our [introductions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/1) thread and don't hesitate to participate in or start a discussion.
