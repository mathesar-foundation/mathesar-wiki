# 2021-04 - Product Designer

**This job was filled in April 2021.**

## The Project
We're looking for a product designer to help build a brand new open source product that helps users of all skill levels use, extend, and visualize their data. We are heavily inspired by [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

The current team is two engineers, we're alumni of Creative Commons and have experience working on open source projects and building community. We're aiming for an initial team size of four, including this position and a frontend engineer. We're based out of the nonprofit [Center of Complex Interventions](https://www.mathesar-foundation.org/) and are advised by Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman.

## The Position
We haven't started writing code for this project yet and your first task will be to help us design and ship the MVP. You'll have full ownership of the product design process, including user interviews, taking ideas from initial conception to high-fidelity designs, and regular usability testing. You'll translate complex data manipulation concepts into a simple and intuitive user interface for non-technical users. You'll collaborate closely with the front end engineer to ship your designs.

This position also involves ownership in building an active community around the product, including participating in conversations with both contributors and users, mentoring for programs like Google Summer of Code, and maintaining documentation, reviewing pull requests, and so on.

We are a fully distributed team, and you can be located anywhere in the world, as long as you are can make time between 2 PM and 8 PM UTC for meetings as needed.

## Qualifications
We're looking for a designer that has extensive experience with translating complex concepts into intuitive web interfaces for non-technical users and working with engineering teams to ship them. You should be an expert in design best practices, especially in accessibility and mobile-friendliness. You should also have experience conducting effective user interviews and usability testing, and generally be an advocate for creating an exceptional user experience.

Excellent communication skills in English (both written and verbal) are essential, since this position is fully remote. You should be able to work independently, build good working relationships remotely, and be a proactive communicator. You should also enjoy writing documentation, helping others, and building a community. You're probably also curious and enjoy learning new things.

Some nice-to-haves:

- understanding of SQL and databases
- design experience with spreadsheet, tables, or large datasets
- experience as a contributor or maintainer of open source software
- familiarity with HTML/CSS

## Salary and Benefits
You will be a salaried employee if you're in the US and an independent contractor otherwise. We offer a competitive salary in the nonprofit sector. We also have a budget for learning material (books, courses, etc.) and conferences.

US employees have the following benefits:

- Medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage (CCI covers 80% of employee costs and 70% of dependent costs for medical insurance and 50% of employee costs for dental and vision insurance).
- Life insurance coverage
- 401(k) forthcoming
