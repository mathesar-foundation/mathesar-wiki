## All Team Members

All team members are encouraged to actively participate in the feedback process, regardless of their assigned roles. This includes flagging or sharing user feedback that they come across during their interactions with Mathesar's users or while monitoring various channels.

## Owner

The owner of the User Feedback responsibility is responsible for the following tasks:

- Monitor the "hello@mathesar.org" email, and follow up with users as needed.
- Document and organize user feedback from all channels, making it easily accessible on the [User Feedback HackMD page](https://hackmd.io/team/user-feedback).
- Categorize collected feedback using appropriate tags and attributes.
- Create surveys and call scripts for the various stages of the feedback process:
    - **Feedback Follow-Up:** Reach out to users that have provided feedback to learn more about their experiences and needs.
    - **Discovery:** Gather information about existing or potential users' needs and goals, and understand the problem space.
    - **Onboarding:** Identify opportunities for improvement in the onboarding experience, particularly for new users.
    - **Satisfaction:** Understand how users feel about Mathesar and their overall experience, particularly for long-term users.
- Create email templates for the various stages of the feedback process:
    - **Call Invitation:** Invite users to participate in a feedback call.
    - **Survey Invitation:** Invite users to participate in a survey.
- Send out emails, surveys, and call invitations to users.
- Schedule and conduct feedback calls with users.
- Manage and maintain additional channels for user feedback, such as roadmaps, user guides, and blogs.
