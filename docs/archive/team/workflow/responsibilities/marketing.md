## Day-to-day maintenance tasks

### Respond to Syften notifications

Syften notifications are auto-assigned to the "Marketing" group in Freshdesk. They cover Hacker News and Reddit.

**If a comment or post can be considered user feedback**, please flag it to the owner of the [user feedback](/archive/team/workflow/responsibilities/user-feedback) responsibility.

#### Process for responding:

- Share the post in the `Mathesar - Marketing` Matrix channel.
- Decide if a response is needed and who will respond.
- Compose a response.
    - Share in the channel if you want feedback before posting.
- Post the response.

#### Guidelines for responding

- **If Mathesar is mentioned**:
    - Responses should be aimed at thanking people, addressing people's concerns, and/or answering questions.
    - Responses should people to existing conversations, issues, and discussions as much as possible.
- **If someone mentions a problem that Mathesar could be used to solve**:
    - Responses should suggest using Mathesar in a tactful way.
    - Our goal here should not be to shoehorn Mathesar into all sorts of use cases. Instead, we should be on the lookout only for cases that Mathesar is a good solution for.

### Respond to Mathesar mentions on Twitter (X?)

Twitter needs to be monitored manually. Sign in to Twitter (credentials in 1Password) and click on the "Notifications" tab.

- Re-tweet it from our account and/or thank them for the shoutout.
- Only re-tweet if the tweet appears to be from a real person or organization. Do not re-tweet bot accounts (e.g. "First Issues Bot").
- Also respond to questions, etc. as outlined in the Syften section.

### Make release announcements

Release announcements should include highlights from release notes. We should avoid the announcements following a template because people tend to ignore repetitive things.

- Post a message in the `Mathesar - General` channel on Matrix announcing the release
- Post a message to the developers and users mailing lists announcing the release
- Tweet when we publish a new release
- *TODO: also figure out where / how to post on Reddit for new releases*

## Sporadic maintenance tasks

- Clean up marketing Freshdesk tickets and close the ones with no action items.
- Evaluate Syften keywords and update them if needed.
- Make progress on our [Mathesar launch publicity checklist](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar-website/issues/78), delegate tasks as needed.
    - We’ll hold off on making new announcements until our installation process is improved
- Keep track of where we’re getting traffic from (using Syften, GitHub Insights and our analytics), and track notable sources in the [Marketing History](/marketing/history) page
    - Also post noteworthy publicity to the `Mathesar - Marketing` channel on Matrix.
- Add Mathesar to aggregators (tracked [in this issue](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar-website/issues/84)).
    - Feel free to ask the owner to review any copy written for this.
- Do research on more relevant aggregators that Mathesar could be added to and add them to the issue.

## Higher-level tasks

- Maintain and execute go-to-market strategy
- Maintain the marketing website, and decide what changes are needed when.
    - Create issues and ensure the work is tracked and delegated appropriately.

## Notes & Resources

- See [Marketing](/marketing) section of the wiki.
- Eventually, the plan is to create an “evangelism guide” ([example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/social-media/))
