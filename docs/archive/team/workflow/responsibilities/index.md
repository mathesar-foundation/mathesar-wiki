# Ongoing responsibilities

- These are ongoing tasks involved in maintaining Mathesar.
- Owners are accountable for the work associated with each responsibility. They also coordinate with helpers as needed.
- Ongoing responsibilities should not be the majority of anyone's work. Most work should be specced out into time-limited [projects](/archive/product/projects).

Please see the navigation for the list of responsibilities.
