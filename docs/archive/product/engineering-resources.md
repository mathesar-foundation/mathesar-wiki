#### Introspection + API Generation
- [PostgREST](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest) - Introspects, generates, and serves OpenAPI-complaint REST apis from Postgres databases.
- [Postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) The same thing, but for GraphQL and written in TypeScript. They have really rich documentation that gets into a lot of interesting Postgres best practices and architectural patterns.
