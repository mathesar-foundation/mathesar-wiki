# Design Principles

Our design principles are a set of beliefs, views, or approaches we chose to guide our design decisions.

## Why do we need design principles?
- To improve our decision process as a team
- To align on what matters
- To promote productive discussions around design problems
- To define specific criteria to measure design solutions

## Principle 1: Focus
Our team does not want to spend time on decisions that don't help our users or us.
### We are process-oriented
- Enable spaces that are appropriate for co-creation, participative design
- Provide an environment in which designers and non-designers feel like their opinions are valued
- Create resources so that the team and community can learn more about design
### We are results-oriented
- Create features that users will accept and care about
- Confirm user satisfaction with the product through objective and subjective measurements, not just one of them

## Principle 2: Impact
We try our best to predict how users will respond to a design and find ways to maximize the benefits and minimize risks. We anticipate the various effects of the project result on the users.
### We value data and empirical support over assumptions
- As we implement features, we gather data, we observe, we iterate based on those observations
- We make assumptions about what will happen to prototype and test our designs, but we are careful to question them and double-check that our beliefs and hypotheses are reasonable

## Principle 3: Adaptability
We consider the whole environment in which our product is used and what interactions are unique to each product component. We adapt to that context by consistently testing and refining our designs.
### Just enough design so that we can adapt to new ideas and fail fast
- We can change the plan as circumstances change
- We are in regular contact with the key stakeholders of the project
