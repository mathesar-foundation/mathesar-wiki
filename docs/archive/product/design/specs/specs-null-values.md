# NULL Value Specs

## Context

A `NULL` value indicates that a value does not exist in a database. It is important to clarify that `NULL` is not the same as blank or zero. Ideally, we want users to think of `NULL` values as placeholders for unknown or missing values applicable otherwise.

## User Experience

### Considerations for handling `NULL` Values

When presented in tables, `NULL` values should be visually distinct so that the user understands that they are not the same as other string types. The style should attempt to communicate the absence of a value, similar to how placeholders are used in text input fields.
As for the process of transforming values to and from `NULL`, it will be important to have a consistent way of doing this across different data types.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User identifies a `NULL` Value

#### Scenario 1a: The user identifies a `NULL` value in a table

##### Steps for 1a

1. The user opens a table that contains `NULL` values.
2. The user identifies a cell that contains a `NULL` value.
    - The cell contains the word `NULL` in all uppercase letters
    - The cell has a different styling
        - A lighter background-color
        - A muted text color
        - A different font style (italic)

#### Scenario 1b: The user identifies a `NULL` value in a record preview

##### Steps for 1b

1. The user edits a value in a column that links to records from another table.
2. The user sees the list of records displayed in the record selection dropdown.
3. The user identifies a record that contains a `NULL` value.
    - The field contains the word `NULL` in all uppercase letters
    - The text has a muted text color
    - The text has a different font style (italic)

#### Scenario 1c: The user identifies a `NULL` value in a boolean type column in checkbox display mode

##### Steps for 1c

1. The user opens a table that contains `NULL` values.
2. The user identifies a cell that contains an indeterminate state checkbox.
3. The user hovers over the indeterminate checkbox, and a tooltip with the legend `NULL` is displayed.

### Scenario 2: User edits a `NULL` Value

#### Scenario 2a: Replacing `NULL` with a new value

##### Steps for 2a

1. The user edits a `NULL` value in a column.
2. The user enters `edit mode`.
3. The user enters a new value and leaves `edit mode` by pressing the `enter` key or clicking outside the active cell.
4. The new value replaces the `NULL` value.

#### Scenario 2b: Replacing `NULL` with an empty string

##### Steps for 2b

1. The user edits a `NULL` value in a column.
2. The user enters `edit mode`.
3. A text input box is displayed in `edit mode` with a placeholder set to `NULL`.
4. The new typed-in value replaces the placeholder text.
5. The user clears the new value by pressing the `backspace` key until the value is completely cleared.
6. The user leaves `edit mode`.
7. An empty string replaces the `NULL` value. The cell appears blank.

#### Scenario 2c: The data type is boolean with checkbox display mode enabled

##### Steps for 2c

1. The user edits a `NULL` value in a column set to boolean type with the checkbox display mode enabled.
    - The field contains a checkbox in an indeterminate state, meaning the value is `NULL`.
2. The user clicks on the checkbox, going from indeterminate `NULL` to checked `TRUE`.
3. The user can click on the checkbox again to mark it as `FALSE`.
4. To return the value to `NULL`, the user can select the cell and press the `delete` key or use the contextual menu and select the `Set as NULL` option.

#### Scenario 2d: The data type is number

##### Steps for 2d

1. The user edits a `NULL` value in a column set to `number` type.
2. The user double-clicks the cell to enter `edit mode.
3. The user leaves `edit mode` without making any changes.
4. The `NULL` value remains unchanged.

### Scenario 3: User sets a value to `NULL`

#### Scenario 3a: The column accepts `NULL` values

##### Steps for 3a

1. The user selects a cell in a column that contains a value.
2. The user clears the content of the selected cell.
    - By pressing the `Shift`+`Backspace` or `Shift`+`Delete` keys.
    - By opening the contextual menu and selecting the `Set as NULL` option.
3. The selected cell now has a `NULL` value.

#### Scenario 3b: The column does not accept `NULL` values

##### Steps for 3b

1. The user selects a cell in a column that contains a value.
2. The user attempts to clear the content of the selected cell.
    - By pressing the `Shift`+`Backspace` or `Shift`+`Delete` keys.
        - The system prevents the insertion of a `NULL` value.
        - An error message indicates that a NOT `NULL` constraint is applied to the column, and the system cannot insert `NULL` values.
    - By opening the contextual menu and selecting the `Set as NULL` option.
        - The 'Set as `NULL`' option is disabled, and the user cannot select it.

## Interactions

### Select vs. Edit Mode Behaviors

In `Select Mode`, the cell is highlighted and set as the target for actions applying to the cell or elements associated with it, such as its row or column. `Select Mode` is toggled by clicking on a cell or by navigating to with the direction keys while `Select Mode` is active.

In `Edit Mode`, a cell provides additional functionality and interactions to users. `Edit Mode` is toggled by double-clicking on a cell or by typing a text character or pressing backspace while in `Select Mode`. However, certain data types could have different interactions. Once specific behaviors and components for each data type are introduced, we must further define these interactions to ensure compatibility.

We will create an additional issue to refine these interactions.

#### Text or Numeric Types

For the implementation of this spec, we should consider the following interactions for the editing of text and numeric types as summarized in the following table:

| current mode | DOM `key` | result |
| -- | -- | -- |
| select | any text character | switch to edit mode, place cursor at end, append a character to end of cell contents |
| select | `Backspace` | switch to edit mode, place cursor at end, delete the last character |
| select | `Delete` | nothing |
| select | `Shift+Backspace` | set cell value to NULL |
| select | `Shift+Delete` | set cell value to NULL |
| edit | `Backspace` | delete a character to the left of cursor |
| edit | `Delete` | delete a character to the right of cursor |

#### Boolean Type

In the case of boolean types, consider the following:

- Consider that the `checkbox` is smaller than the cell, so clicking outside the `checkbox` would select the cell, and pressing `delete` would make the cell `NULL.`
- Clicking inside the `checkbox` would toggle the value of the checkbox, similar to spreadsheets.

#### With Dropdown Enabled

Some column configurations will display a dropdown when editing the contents of a cell. For example, a column with a single-column foreign key constraint will show a record selector dropdown when in edit mode.

In the case of cells with dropdown enabled, consider the following:

- If no record is selected, the cell content should be `NULL`.
- To set the cell's content as `NULL`, the user can press the `delete` key while the cell is in `select mode`.
- To set the cell's content as `NULL`, the user can deselect a selected record from the record selector by clicking on a selected item and then closing the dropdown.
