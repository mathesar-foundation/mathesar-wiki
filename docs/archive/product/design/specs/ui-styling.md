# User Interface Style

## Context
Mathesar's user interface design encompasses its visual elements and interactions' aesthetic, responsiveness, efficiency, and accessibility. Essentially what the user sees when they interact with the product.

## General Guidelines
### Fonts
Mathesar's user interface should incorporate a readable sans-serif font that is optimized for web and mobile interfaces.

#### Scale
The distance between the smallest and largest font size on a typographic scale should be minimal and just enough to create contrast and hierarchy between content. 

#### Contrast
The design should employ contrast to improve the readability of interface elements and increase the visual relevance of some interactive elements.

##### Accesibility
The contrast of the design should be based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. (WCAG)

### Colors
The design should support both light and dark modes and apply colors in a way that emphasizes important elements that assist users in:

- Identifying type of objects (table, views)
- Differentiating states of objects (active, default, disabled)
- Cell, row, and column positioning
- Status of a task (saving, loading, adding, deleting)

#### Themes
The design should allow modification of its colors via themes so that users can suit it to their preferences.
