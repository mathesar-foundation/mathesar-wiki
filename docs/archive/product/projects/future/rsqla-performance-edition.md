## Problem

- Mathesar's performance is bad when there are a large number of database objects, under any conditions.
- Mathesar's performance is bad to the point of unusability when there's any network latency between the web service and the user's database(s).

### Example

To exemplify the performance problem, I set up a test DB with:

- an empty `public` Schema,
- 3 schemata,
- 5 tables per schema,
- 8 columns per table, and
- 10 rows per table.

I added 50ms of latency to calls between the web service and the DB, in order to simulate a non-colocated setup (50ms is pretty quick, actually; From me to our internal.mathesar.org DB is more like 200ms). I then performed the following user flow:

1. Login
2. Click a random schema.
3. Click a random table in that schema.
4. Add a `TEXT` column to that table.
5. Navigate back to the schema page (i.e., where the tables are listed)
6. Add a table from import (patrons_sim.csv, no type inference).

Below is a screenshot showing the recorded times for all requests to http://localhost:8000.

More tables, or columns per table makes the situation worse. Here's the same experiment, with the single change of having 10 tables per schema, with 15 columns per table:

## Solution

We should tackle the slowest endpoints above (and maybe the column inference endpoint), removing all SQLAlchemy reflection calls from the code paths.

## Outcome

The endpoints we fix should run noticeably faster (I expect by a factor of 100x)

## Risks

We need to rearchitect how these calls work for this to be feasible.
