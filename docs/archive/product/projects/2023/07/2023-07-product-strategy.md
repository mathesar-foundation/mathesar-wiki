## Problem
We need a strategy to help us decide what Mathesar's product roadmap should be. We should have a clear idea of where we're headed, what features are important for us to build, and how our product work will help us achieve our goals of user growth and sustainability.

## Solution
We need to understand:

- The kinds of problems that Mathesar is best suited to solve.
- What our users are missing or struggling with and how to improve our product to meet their needs.
- What kinds of features will expand the use cases that Mathesar can be used for.

### Tasks
As part of the project, we'll be doing some of the following:

- Research and categorization of user feedback and problems
- Ideation (forming hypotheses) and discussion with the team
- Talking to users or potential users if we can
- Developing personas ans strategy documents (see "Outcome" below)

## Outcome
At the end of this project, we expect to have:

- A set of user personas / use cases that we're targeting.
- A strategy document that outlines user needs and product priorities.
- A framework that can help us make feature development decisions quickly.
  - This includes a plan for ongoing user research and how it will be integrated into our roadmap planning.

## Risks
The timeline is short, and we'll be prioritizing being decisive. This means we may need to course correct in the future as we get more information.

Next steps are to finalize the strategy and personas and develop a product roadmap once the [niche research](/archive/product/projects/2023/08/niche-research) project is complete in Cycle 2.
