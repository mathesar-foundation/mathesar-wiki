## Problem

We need a process to manage and categorize user feedback for easy access and reference, which will help the team improve new and existing features.

We must also create templates for various feedback collection methods, identify and engage an initial group of users, and conduct calls and surveys to evaluate their effectiveness and overall impact on our product development.

## Solution

### 1. Set up a User Feedback Management Tool

We will establish a HackMD team called "User Feedback" to streamline note creation and organization. This will provide a dedicated space for managing user feedback.

### 2. Develop Feedback Capture Templates

We will create templates for managing user feedback, calls, surveys, and email invitations, ensuring consistency and quality when gathering user feedback. These templates will be available within the HackMD "User Feedback" team.

This includes:

- **Feedback Capture Template:** A template for capturing user feedback from various channels, such as emails, calls, and surveys.
  - **Social Listening Template:** A template for capturing user feedback from social listening. Mentions of Mathesar on Github, HackerNews, Twitter, Reddit, and other social media platforms will be captured here.
- **Call Template:** A template for conducting calls with users.
  - **Discovery Call Template:** A template for conducting discovery calls with users.
  - **Onboarding Call Template:** A template for conducting onboarding calls with users.
  - **Satisfaction Call Template:** A template for conducting satisfaction calls with users.
  - **Feedback Follow-Up Call Template:** A template for conducting feedback follow-up calls with users.
- **Survey Template:** A template for conducting surveys with users.
  - **Discovery Survey Template:** A template for conducting discovery surveys with users.
  - **Onboarding Survey Template:** A template for conducting onboarding surveys with users.
  - **Satisfaction Survey Template:** A template for conducting satisfaction surveys with users.
  - **Feedback Follow-Up Survey Template:** A template for conducting feedback follow-up surveys with users.

### 3. Develop Email Templates

We will create templates for emails to invite users to participate in calls and surveys.

This includes:

- **Invitation Email Template:** A template for sending email invitations to users.
- **Survey Email Template:** A template for sending survey emails to users.
- **Feedback Follow-Up Email Template:** A template for sending feedback follow-up emails to users.

### 4. Identify and Engage Users for Feedback Collection

We will identify an initial group of users, compile a list, and reach out to them using our email templates. We will ask them to participate in calls and surveys.

### 5. Schedule and Conduct Calls and Surveys

We will schedule calls with users who are interested in participating and distribute surveys to users who are not available for calls.

### 6. Analyze and Categorize Survey Answers and Calls

We will determine how to incorporate the notes and answers from surveys into our "User Feedback" collection, ensuring that feedback is properly categorized and accessible to the team.

### 7. Evaluate and Improve Feedback Collection Methods

We will evaluate the effectiveness of calls and surveys and make improvements to the process.
Some questions to consider:

- Is the feedback we are collecting useful?
- Do we need to make changes to the survey or call templates?
- Are we interacting with the right users?
