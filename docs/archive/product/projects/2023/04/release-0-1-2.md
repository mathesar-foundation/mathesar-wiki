## Work plan
- Create necessarry issues and clean up milestone v0.1.2.
- Installation improvements and Implementation of switching user databases will happen in parallel.
  - Any critical issue that comes up during this phase will be taken up in the same release based on effort involved and user impact.
  - If an issue requires a hotfix, it will take the hightest priority and v0.1.2 will be a hotfix release, and this plan will shift to the next release.
- Hire testing team, prepare testing plan, and manage testing once required features are complete.
- Handle issues that might come up during testing.
- The release process will remain same as our previous releases.
  - Here is the release process document for creating a release.
  - The release management ongoing responsibility is not yet documented. It will be updated during the course of this release and will contain more detailed information.

The plan is more high level, since individual tasks will be tracked using GH issues.

## Risks
- There are unknowns with testing since we're hiring external people, which might affect the timeline.
- Issues uncovered during testing might affect the timeline.

## Resources
- **Milestone**: [v0.1.2](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/milestone/68)

## Timeline
* Deadline for release will be **2023-05-10**.
* This is around 30 days from the start date, higher than anticipated, but essential for Installation improvements.
* The release branch will be frozen by **2023-05-28**. All PRs merged by then will be part of the release. Fixes for issues raised after that will be made on the release branch.
