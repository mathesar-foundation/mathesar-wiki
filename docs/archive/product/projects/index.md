# Projects

## Overview

### Purpose

- The Mathesar team's work is chunked into fixed-length projects to keep it organized.
- The Mathesar maintainers work in 4-week "cycles", and each project is designed to fit into that timeline. The community team's project lengths vary.
		- Projects always have an end date. Work without an end date is tracked under [ongoing responsibilities](/archive/team/workflow/responsibilities/).
- Each project has one and only owner, and various helpers. Helpers are assigned specific responsibilities.

### Process

- Anyone willing to do the work can propose a project. Please use the [project template](/archive/product/projects/template).
- Projects are discussed and approved by the Mathesar maintainers (either in meetings or via email).
		- The project manager facilitates these discussions.
- Project prioritization will be based on our product strategy (currently in development).
