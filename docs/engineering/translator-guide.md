# Translator Guide

Welcome! This guide is for contributors who want to help translate Mathesar into different languages. Whether you're an experienced translator or new to the process, this document outlines everything you need to get started.

## Translating Mathesar

Mathesar uses [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/mathesar/mathesar/) to manage all translations. It‚Äôs an online localization platform that allows our global community to collaboratively translate Mathesar into multiple languages.

The [Mathesar Transifex project](https://explore.transifex.com/mathesar/mathesar/) lists all available languages, shows the percentage completed for each one, and provides tools for contributing directly through your browser.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Transifex Account**
   Go to [transifex.com](https://www.transifex.com/) and sign up for a free account if you don‚Äôt have one. You can also log in with an existing GitHub account.
2. **Join the Mathesar Project**
   * Visit the [Mathesar project on Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/mathesar/mathesar/).
   * Click the "Join this Project" button.
   * Select your preferred language(s) or request to add a new one.
   * After selecting your language(s), a Mathesar maintainer will manually approve your request to join. This can take up to 24 hours.
   * Once approved, you can start translating right away.

### Adding new languages

If you've already joined the Mathesar translation team and chosen a language(s) to help translate, and would like to add another, the process is somewhat confusing.

You must select an existing language from the Mathesar project, and click the "view resources" button. Then, on the next page, click the "falafel" (three vertical dots) menu and choose "Join team", like so:

## Working in Transifex

On the Mathesar project you'll see the list of avaliable languages. Hover over your desired language and then hit the "Translate" button to get started.

You'll see two resources avaliable for translation in each language:

- The `django.po` includes strings for Mathesar's backend and actions related to logging in and out, pasword resets, etc.
- The `dict.json` file includes the vast majority of strings needing translation.

### Best Practices

* **Translate meaning, not just words.**
  Focus on clarity and natural phrasing for your audience.
* **Preserve placeholders and variables.**
  Texts like `{username}` or `[text]` must remain unchanged within strings. These are dynamic values, for example the name of a database or the count of returned rows on a table page.
* **Check for existing terminology.**
  Reuse terms from the glossary or previously translated strings to maintain consistency.
* **Ask if unsure.**
  Use the Transifex comment threads or reach out on our community channels if a string is unclear.
