These are the steps that we follow for creating a new Mathesar release.

# Pre-release
The owner of the release project will be responsible for publishing a new Mathesar release.

For details on the Release management process, refer the [Release management ongoing responsibility document](/team/responsibilities/release-management.md).

## 1. Track the process in a GH issue
- Create a meta issue to track progress of the release process with the label `work: release`.
- Eg., [Release 0.1.1 #2705](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2705). Follow the template of this issue.

## 2. Create the release branch and update version number
- Create a release branch out of `develop`. The name of the branch should be the release version, without any prefix.
  - Eg., for release `v0.1.2`, the name of the branch should be `0.1.2`. Do not prefix `v` here.
- Update the version number in the branch in  `mathesar/__init__.py`.
- Update the version number in `install.sh`.
	- This should be the default value for the `github_tag` variable. For example, for version `0.1.3`, you'd put 
    ```sh
    github_tag=${1-"0.1.3"}
    ```
- Update the version number in the documentation for the Installation instructions.

## 3. Make images from the branch and push to Dockerhub - *Do not tag as `latest`*.
- Clone the branch locally.
- Ensure you're logged into Dockerhub. (credentials are in 1Password)
- Run the following commands to build and push the images with the version number.
  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container
  docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-caddy:<version_number> --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -f Dockerfile.caddy .
  docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-prod:<version_number> --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push --build-arg PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS=requirements-prod.txt .
  ```
- These images are not tagged as latest will not affect installation flow for users.
- Log out of Dockerhub to avoid accidental pushes during testing.

## 4. Test installing the new version
- Clear out your docker containers, images, and volumes:
  ```sh
  docker rm -f $(docker ps -a | awk '{print $1}')
  docker rmi $(docker image ls | awk '{print $3}')
  docker volume rm $(docker volume ls | awk '{print $2}')
  ```
  This is just to ensure that the below validation starts from a known state.
- Clear out remains of prevoius installations if any.
	- Eg., Delete `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml` file within `/etc/mathesar`.
- Locally tag the new version as `latest`:
  ```sh
  docker image pull mathesar/mathesar-caddy:<version_number>
  docker image tag mathesar/mathesar-caddy:<version_number> mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest
  
  docker image pull mathesar/mathesar-prod:<version_number>
  docker image tag mathesar/mathesar-prod:<version_number> mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest
  ```
- Install the new version:
  ```sh
  bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centerofci/mathesar/<version_number>/install.sh)
  ```
  - Note that the installation command will vary based on the installation method you use. The above command used the interactive installer.
  - Ensure that the installation process does not throw any errors.


### (Optional) For releases which have changes to installation/upgrade setup:
- In case if the release contains changes to installation/upgrade setup, we need to attempt all installation methods and upgrade processes additionally.
- Ideally, this testing would already be taken care of during the course of the release projects.
- To test upgrades for the docker-compose setup, follow the below steps:
	 - Clean up local docker images and containers.
   - Install the current publised version of Mathesar.
   		- Eg., Assuming the current version is `0.1.0`, and the new version we need to release is `0.1.1`:
        ```sh
        bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centerofci/mathesar/0.1.0/install.sh)
        ```
    - Open Mathesar on browser, create a few tables. Ensure the version shown in the product is the old one. i.e `0.1.0`.
   - Run the following commands while Mathesar is running:
     ```sh
     docker image pull mathesar/mathesar-caddy:0.1.1
     docker image tag mathesar/mathesar-caddy:0.1.1 mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest

     docker image pull mathesar/mathesar-prod:0.1.1
     docker image tag mathesar/mathesar-prod:0.1.1 mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest
     ```
     - Replace `0.1.1` with the new version number.
   - Open browser, make the following request manually. The request cannot be made via UI since there isn't a GH release at this point:
      ```javascript
			fetch('http://localhost/api/ui/v0/upgrade/', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'X-CSRFToken': '<replace_with_csrf_token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({}) });
      ```
      - The CSRF token can be found by looking at your cookies. It is named csrftoken.
   - Reload the page after request ends. Mathesar should now be upgraded.
   - Ensure the version in the Software update page shows the new version. Eg., `0.1.1`.
      - It will show an error saying release notes aren't present. This is expected.
   - Ensure that the upgrade process does not throw any errors.

## 5. Testing
- Perform a smoke test on the product â€“ Install the library management dataset, [follow the library management demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edbba-h4L-M&t=17s) and ensure everything works as expected.
- Certain releases might require extensive testing. This will be mentioned in the release project spec.

### If problems are encountered:
- If problems are encoutered during testing, make issues in the same release milestone.
- The PRs for issues should be based off of the release branch, and merged into the release branch.
- Once all issues are fixed, restart the process from Step 3: Making the images.

## 6. Write up Release notes
- Write the release notes and get approval from Kriti.
- These should be written in Markdown outside of GitHub.
- These should not list the list of issues closed; GitHub will automatically generate that.

# Publishing the release

## 1. Merge into master
- Merge the release branch into `master`.
- Ensure the release branch is deleted after merge. This should happen automatically after merging.
 > Note that after merging the documentation change, if someone is using the docs off of the `master` branch, they'll get a 404 until the tag actually exists. Therefore, avoid going to lunch while things are in this state.

## 2. Create a tag
- Tag the commit you've just merged with the version number of the release.
- Tags are created at https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/tags. You can also tag locally and push the tag to GitHub.

## 3. Build, tag, and push release Docker images
- Clone a fresh version of the repo from `master`.
- `cd` to repository, check out the commit that you've tagged.
- Make sure you're logged into DockerHub (credentials are in 1Password)
- Run the following commands, replacing `<version_number>` with the actual version:
  ```sh
  docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container
  docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-caddy:<version_number> -t mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -f Dockerfile.caddy .
  docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-prod:<version_number> -t mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push --build-arg PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS=requirements-prod.txt .
  ```
- Note that the release needs to be tagged as `latest`.

## 4. Create release in GitHub
- Releases are made here: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/releases
- The release should be associated with the tag you made in the previous step and use the release notes.
- Auto generate the list of closed issues using GitHub's UI and add them to the release notes. 

## 5. Merge master into develop
- After the release is made successfully, merge the `master` branch into `develop`.
