## About us

Mathesar is an open source project to provide an intuitive interface to databases that anyone can host on their own server. We make it easy for non-technical users to create, organize, and analyze data collaboratively, without any prior knowledge of database concepts. 

We started prototyping the project in March 2021 and are working towards our first (alpha) release in 2022. Although you can't see Mathesar in action yet, [this video of Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY) will give you an idea of the ease of use we're aiming for.

Our core team is small and globally distributed. We work asynchronously, value thoughtfulness and curiosity, and practice work/life balance. Our advisors include Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman. Our work is public - look through[  our code](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar), read[  our project and team wiki](/home), and join[  our communication channels](/community).
