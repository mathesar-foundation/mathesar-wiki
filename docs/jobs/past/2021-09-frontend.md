**This job was closed to new applicants on 2021-09-10**

We're looking for a frontend engineer to work on [Mathesar](http://mathesar.org/), a brand new open source project that will enable users of all skill levels to store, visualize, and collaborate with others on data. We're currently working hard on our alpha version, which we are aiming to ship by November 2021. We're based out of the nonprofit [Center of Complex Interventions](https://www.mathesar-foundation.org/) (CCI) and are advised by Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman.

## The Position
You'll be collaborating closely with everyone on the existing [Mathesar team](/team) to build out the frontend for the project. Our frontend stack is Svelte and TypeScript, and our initial roadmap for the MVP is [on GitHub](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

We're working on interesting problems related to simplifying and automating database operations to make them easy to work with for non-technical users without sacrificing flexibility for advanced users. We're still working on the first version of the product, so there's ample opportunity to provide input into the direction of the project from both the technical and usability perspectives. You'll also have opportunities to contribute to backend and infrastructure work if you desire â€“ we are an informal team.

This position also involves ownership in building an active community around the product, including participating in conversations with both contributors and users, mentoring for programs like Google Summer of Code, and maintaining documentation, reviewing pull requests, and so on.

We are a fully distributed team and work mostly asynchronously via [Matrix](/community) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/discussions). You can be located anywhere in the world, as long as you are can make time between 2 PM and 8 PM UTC for occasional video calls and team events.

## Qualifications
We expect you to:

- have had production experience with architecting, building, and deploying complex data-driven frontend applications using a modern JavaScript framework such as Svelte, Vue, or React.
- have had experience with ensuring frontend accessibility, scalability, and performance.
- have experience working professionally within an engineering team.
- have excellent verbal communication skills in English.
- enjoy explaining your ideas quickly, clearly, and comprehensively in writing.
- work independently, build good working relationships remotely, and communicate proactively.
- be an advocate for an exceptional user experience.
- be interested in building an open source community and helping others contribute to the project.
- be curious and enjoy learning new things.

You get bonus points if you have experience with any of the following:

- Svelte and TypeScript.
- Python (especially Django or SQL Alchemy).
- Relational databases and SQL.
- Open source contribution or community building.
- Remote (especially asynchronous) work.
- Collaborating with designers.
- Usability testing.

## Interview Process
The interview process will consist of four rounds:

* **Round 1**: 1 hour technical interview with our frontend engineer.
* **Round 2**: We'll assign you an open issue on the Mathesar repository and ask you to complete it. This is aimed at giving everyone involved a look at what it would be like to work together day to day.
* **Round 3**: 1 hour interview with our designer and backend engineer.
* **Round 4**: 45 min interview with our project lead.

The final candidate will also have a conversation with CCI's Executive Director to learn more about the organization.
